"   sudo.vim:  A vim plugin by Rich Paul (vim@rich-paul.net)
"
"   This script eases use of vim with sudo by adding the ability to
"   edit one file with root privileges without running the whole
"   session that way.
"
"   Usage:  put it in the plugin directory, and
"       (command line): vim sudo:/etc/passwd
"       (within vim):   :e sudo:/etc/passwd
"
"   sudo will ask for your password if need be.
